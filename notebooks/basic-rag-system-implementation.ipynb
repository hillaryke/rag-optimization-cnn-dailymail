      "(CNN)Share, and your gift will be multiplied. That may sound like an esoteric adage, but when Zully Broussard selflessly decided to give one of her kidneys to a stranger, her generosity paired up with big data. It resulted in six patients receiving transplants. That surprised and wowed her. \"I thought I was going to help this one person who I don't know, but the fact that so many people can have a life extension, that's pretty big,\" Broussard told CNN affiliate KGO. She may feel guided in her generosity by a higher power. \"Thanks for all the support and prayers,\" a comment on a Facebook page in her name read. \"I know this entire journey is much bigger than all of us. I also know I'm just the messenger.\" CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the page. But the power that multiplied Broussard's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from donor-recipient pairs. It works on a simple swapping principle but takes it to a much higher level, according to California Pacific Medical Center\n"

People around him were taken aback, but he was very calm,\" said Dr. John Linton. \"He was speaking with his doctor on what to do.
