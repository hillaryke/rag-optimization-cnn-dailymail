Critics of Putin have in the past suffered miserable fates. Last year, a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of Russian journalist and fierce Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya. Business magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky accused Putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps. Late last year, Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny was found guilty of fraud in a politically charged trial. Russia\\'s official news agency reported Monday that a request by Navalny to attend Nemtsov\\'s funeral had been denied. And before his death, Nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin\\'s government. Kasparov, chairman of the Human Rights Foundation\\'s International Council, suggested the killing was linked to the Kremlin\\'s own insecurity. \"If you are popular your critics don\\'t have to be shot down in front of the Kremlin,\" Kasparov',\n",

Some Putin opponents claim it isn't a coincidence that critics of the powerful leader and his government have been killed or landed behind bars. But the Kremlin has staunchly denied accusations that it's targeting political opponents or had anything to do with the deaths. Here's a look at some cases of outspoken critics of Putin's government who've ended up in exile, under house arrest, behind bars or dead. The business magnate backed an opposition party and accused Putin of corruption. He spent more than 10 years behind bars on charges of tax evasion and fraud. In statements to CNN, Khodorkovsky said his prosecution was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take control of Yukos, the oil company he built from privatization deals in the 1990s.

Nemtsov had been one of Putin\\'s harshest critics and had been arrested several times for speaking against the President\\'s government. The 55-year-old opposition leader was gunned down Friday night in Moscow as he walked across a bridge about 100 meters (330 feet) from the Kremlin with his girlfriend, Ukrainian model Anna Duritskaya, 23. His slaying spurred thousands to rally in his honor in Moscow, with many calling him a true Russian patriot at his funeral Tuesday. Nemtsov isn\\'t the first of Putin\\'s critics to turn up dead, with others including Anna Politkovskaya (who was fatally shot) and Alexander Litvinenko (who was poisoned).

The three suspects visited by Tsvetkov deny they are guilty and have appealed their arrests, he said. Putin has condemned Nemtsov's killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate, the Kremlin has said. He also wrote to Nemtsov's mother, saying he shared her grief, and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice.

Nemtsov had also been arrested several times for speaking against the government. In her first TV interview since her father\\'s death, Nemtsova told CNN that Putin shares \"political responsibility\" for her father\\'s assassination.
