Your brother can then get on a years-long waiting list for a kidney coming from an organ donor who died. Maybe that will work out -- or not, and time could run out for him. Alternatively, you and your brother could look for another recipient-living donor couple like yourselves -- say, two more siblings, where the donor's kidney isn't suited for his sister, the recipient. But maybe your kidney is a match for his sister, and his kidney is a match for your brother. So, you'd do a swap. That's called a paired donation.

Spieth won a three-way play-off with a 28-foot birdie on the third extra hole to become only the fourth player since 1940 to win twice on the PGA Tour before turning 22. It is a feat that not even McIlroy mastered with Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia and Robert Gamez the only players to have achieved that particular accolade in the past 75 years. But it is the Northern Irishman that is within Spieth\\'s focus heading towards Augusta. \"I like studying the game, being a historian of the game,\" Spieth told the PGA Tour website. \"It\\'s really cool to have my name go alongside those. \"But right now currently what I\\'m really focused on is Rory McIlroy and the No.1 in the world. That\\'s who everyone is trying to chase. \"That\\'s our ultimate goal to eventually be the best in the world and this is a great, great stepping stone.

The Northern Irishman feigned to repeat his earlier antics, before placing it back in the bag. His mistake led to a double bogey six and left him tied for ninth at one-under-par, eight shots behind winner Dustin Johnson. McIlroy had promised to return the club to Trump after the round and was as good as his word. \"We\\'re thinking about auctioning it for charity or doing a trophy case for Doral, putting it on a beautiful mount,\" Trump said. Johnson is looking set to be one of McIlroy\\'s main rivals in the first major of the season, the U.S. Masters at Augusta, next month and his victory completed a triumphant comeback to the PGA Tour. The 30-year-old American took a six-month break from the Tour last July to cope with \"personal problems\" and returned earlier this year. Johnson finished with a three-under',\n",

The 68-year-old American entrepreneur presented it to McIlroy before his final round Sunday, telling him that it was unlucky to continue playing with 13 clubs as against the usual 14 allowed under golf\\'s rules. \"He\\'s never one to miss an opportunity,\" McIlroy told the official PGA Tour website after his round. \"It was fine.

Before continuing his round with a dropped ball, the four-time major winner launched the 3-iron used to play the offending shot into the water as well. \"(It) felt good at the time,\" a rueful McIlroy later said of the incident in comments carried by the PGA Tour website. \"I just let frustration get the better of me.
