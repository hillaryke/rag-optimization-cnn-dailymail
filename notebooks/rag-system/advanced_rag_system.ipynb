The Wisconsin governor, amid charges from critics that he\\'s a flip-flopper, also acknowledged that he had changed positions on immigration reform but argued that he\\'s remained consistent in everything else. Walker was met with great fanfare at his only open event during his two-day stop to the first-in-the-nation primary state. Activists gathered at Concord High School for a training event that was hosted by the New Hampshire GOP and headlined by Walker\\'s appearance. Jeb Bush makes 2016 debut in New Hampshire .
