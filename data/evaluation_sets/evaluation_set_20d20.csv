"What is the significance of cherry trees in Washington, D.C.?","['Washington (CNN)There should be plenty of pent-up anticipation among cherry blossom fans in Washington this spring. Peak blooms are expected at the tail end of the three-week-long National Cherry Blossom Festival, which kicks off Friday and runs through April 12. The fluttering pink and white blossoms are expected to hit their peak between April 11 and April 14. Here are five things to know about the eagerly awaited D.C. blossoms: . The city\'s first cherry trees were destroyed . In 1910, 2,000 cherry trees arrived in Washington, thanks to a gift from the city of Tokyo and the advocacy of Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, one of the first female board members of the National Geographic Society. These trees, however, were riddled with disease and were destroyed. Two years later, first lady Helen Herron Taft planted one of the first of more than 3,000 replacement trees sent from Japan. Winter\'s almost over: See the proof . The festival was launched more than 20 years later . It wasn\'t until 1935 that civic groups and the D.C. government came together to hold the first ""Cherry Blossom Festival."" That first official festival came after smaller commemorations including a three-day celebration in 1934 and a 1927 re-enactment of the original planting of the trees by a group of Washington school children. It\'s not all about cherry trees . That\'s right, there\'s a Blossom Kite Festival right in the middle of the cherry blossom festivities on March 28th. The festival consists of a hot tricks showdown, learning how to make and fly kites, and there\'s even a kite doctor on site to repair broken kites. Two types of trees dominate . In the 1912 gift of trees to Washington, there were 12 different varieties. Today, two varieties are dominant -- Yoshino and Kwanzan. Kwanzan trees are usually found in the East Potomac Park area and produce pink blossoms. The Yoshino, which produce white blossoms, are closer to the northern part of the Tidal Basin near the Washington Monument. Descendants of the original trees live in Japan . In 2011, about 120 trees propagated from D.C.\'s surviving 1912 trees were sent back to Japan to preserve the genetic lineage of the symbolic trees. Over the years, cuttings from the original trees have also been returned to Japan for horticultural projects.']","Cherry trees hold great significance in Washington, D.C. as they are a symbol of the friendship between the United States and Japan. The gift of cherry trees from Japan to Washington, D.C. in 1912 has led to the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival, which attracts millions of visitors each year. The cherry blossoms also represent the arrival of spring and are a beautiful sight for locals and tourists alike.",simple,"[{'source': 'cnn_dailymail', 'id': '1e84a98d5b4673b200c81e69bd286561656c318f'}]",True
What is one of the events that Hillary Clinton will be participating in during the month of March that involves a paid appearance?,"['(CNN)After a handful events in two months, Hillary Clinton has filled her March with a mix of women\'s events, nonprofit speeches and at least one paid appearance. In January and February, Clinton headlined three events -- only one of which was in the United States. But as Clinton moves closer to her expected 2016 presidential campaign announcement, the former secretary or state has at least seven events scheduled for the month of March. Most of Clinton\'s events are focused on one thing: women. Clinton starts her month by headlining the 30th anniversary gala for Emily\'s List -- a pro-Clinton organization that focused on helping Democratic women win elected office. At the D.C. speech on March 3, Clinton is expected to give a nod to the group\'s importance to Democrats and highlight the reason more women are needed in politics. Emily\'s List has been energized by Clinton\'s campaign and has pledged to raise and spend more money than any other election cycle because of the prospect of a Clinton White House. The following week, Clinton will headline two New York events tied to her 1995 speech to the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing -- a speech Clinton regularly references in pitches to women. In that speech Clinton said, ""If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women\'s rights and women\'s rights are human rights once and for all."" On March 9, Clinton teams up with Chelsea, her daughter, and Melinda Gates to release a report through the Clinton Foundation that looks at ""the gaps that still remain"" in women\'s participation in the economy and politics. The following day -- on March 10 -- Clinton will headline the United Nation\'s Women Empowerment Principles annual gathering in New York. Clinton will use the speech to outline the findings in the Clinton Foundation report and ""reflect on progress made in implementing the agenda set in Beijing two decades ago,"" the organizers said in a release about the event. On March 16, Clinton will be inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame at an event in New York. Clinton is not Irish -- her family is of English, Scottish, French, and Welsh descent -- but she is being honored because of ""her dedicated work on Irish Peace Process."" ""Hillary Rodham Clinton is one of the unsung heroes of the success of the Irish peace process,"" said Irish America co-founder Niall O\'Dowd. In 1998, Clinton put together the Vital Voices Conference of women in Belfast, a body that pressed for a piece agreement. The former secretary of state cited her experiences in Ireland during a number of speeches in 2014. O\'Dowd is a longtime Clinton supporter, though,and was a member of her 2008 campaign finance team. Some Republicans have questioned how active Clinton was in the Northern Ireland peace process. The Washington Post Fact Checker wrote in 2008 that Clinton ""seems to be overstating her significance as a catalyst in the Northern Ireland peace process, which was more symbolic than substantive,"" but that she did play ""a helpful role at the margins."" On March 19, Clinton will headline her only confirmed paid speech of the month when she heads to Atlantic City for the American Camp Association, NY & NJ Conference. Susie Lupert, the group\'s executive director, tells CNN, ""Yes, just like most nonprofits and conferences, she is being paid for her appearance."" But she would not confirm how much she is being paid. On average, Clinton makes between $200,000 and $300,000 per speech. Near the end of the month, on March 23 in Washington, D.C., Clinton will be the keynote speaker at the award celebration for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting from Syracuse University. Robin Toner, who graduated from Syracuse, was the first woman national political correspondent for the New York Times. Syracuse Dean Lorraine Branham said Clinton is a ""vivid example — like Robin — of a pioneering woman at the top of her profession."" Clinton headlining an event honoring political journalists is somewhat unique because for decades she has held a dim view of the profession. In a 1996, according to the diary of the late Clinton confidant Diane Blair, Clinton said the media are ""complete hypocrites."" At an event in 2014, Clinton said ""journalism has changed quite a bit in a way that is not good for the country and not good for journalism."" ""A lot of serious news reporting has become more entertainment driven and more opinion-driven as opposed to factual,"" she said. ""People book onto the shows, political figures, commentators who will be controversial who will be provocative because it\'s a good show. You might not learn anything but you might be entertained and I think that\'s just become an unfortunate pattern that I wish could be broken."" Clinton\'s presidential campaign has become a forgone conclusion and Democrats close to Clinton expect she will announce some official move towards the presidency in April.']","Hillary Clinton will be participating in the American Camp Association, NY & NJ Conference in Atlantic City on March 19, which is a paid appearance.",simple,"[{'source': 'cnn_dailymail', 'id': 'f04ad85fb2c19e4bf27641c07b357649ddec039f'}]",True
What role did the United States-led coalition play in the fight against ISIS according to King Abdullah II of Jordan?,"['(CNN)In his first interview since Islamic State militants burned alive a Jordanian pilot, the King of Jordan spoke to CNN\'s Fareed Zakaria about why and how the country is going after the terror group. Last December, ISIS captured Royal Jordanian Air Force pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh after his plane went down during airstrikes that were part of the United States-led coalition to defeat the group. For more than a month, al-Kasasbeh\'s family, hailing from a high-ranking tribe considered especially loyal to Jordan\'s royal family, implored ISIS to let him go. Hope that he could be spared ended in early February when a video emerged showing the 29-year-old pilot in a cage, being burned alive. King Abdullah II, an instrumental supporter of the global coalition, then said Jordan would be relentless in retaliating against ISIS. The country unleashed airstrikes. To Zakaria, Abdullah reiterated his commitment to stop ISIS. He called its fighters ""outlaws"" who twist Islam and use ""intimidation"" as their biggest weapon. The King told Zakaria that he didn\'t watch the video of the pilot\'s slaying. ""I -- many of us refused to see what I think is propaganda,"" Abdullah said. He felt ""disgust, sadness for the family"" and his ""heart went out to the father, the mother, the brothers, the sisters,"" the King continued. ""His wife, they\'d only been married for five months. (I felt) anger as the son of the Arab army, Jordanian armed forces. God bless his soul. He\'s a brother in arms. ""All soldiers past and present were disgusted by the brutality of what Moath was put through,"" Abdullah said. During his interview with Zakaria, the King repeatedly referred to ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, as Daesh. That\'s an acronym for al-Dawla al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham. Many in the Middle East prefer to use Daesh because, to them, the acronym ISIS suggests the terror group is a legitimate state. They refuse to give the militants that much credit. ""I think if ISIS, or Daesh as we call them, try to intimidate Jordanians ... just (has) the reverse effect,"" Abdullah said. ""If you look at our history, we\'re a country that\'s used to being outgunned and outnumbered. We\'ve always punched way above our weight. I think, if anything, Daesh has us as a tiger by the tail."" The pilot\'s killing ""just motivated Jordanians to rally around the flag,"" he said. ""The gloves have come off."" ISIS is ""always trying to intimidate, scare, put fear in people\'s hearts,"" the King told Zakaria. ""They are trying to invent falsely a linkage to a caliphate, link to our history in Islam that has no truth or bearing to our history."" ISIS is recruiting ""deluded young men and women"" who ""think this is an Islamic nation."" U.S. President Barack Obama has caught flak for saying he didn\'t want to refer to ISIS members as Islamic extremists because their actions are not Islamic. ""I think he is right,"" Abdullah said. ""This is something that has to be understood on a much larger platform. (ISIS) is looking for legitimacy (that) they have inside of Islam."" ""I\'m a Muslim,"" the King said. ""These people (ISIS members) ... are on the fringe of Islam."" ""The barbarity with the way they executed our brave hero (the pilot), I think, shocked the Muslim world, especially Jordanians and people from this region,"" Abdullah said. In the wake of the pilot\'s death, a Jordanian government spokesman vowed an ""earthshaking retaliation."" Zakaria asked Abdullah if Jordan\'s action has lived up to that fiery rhetoric. ""Earth-shattering from all military capabilities is not something that happens overnight,"" he answered, saying that airstrikes have continued. ""There are continued operations going on in Syria. We are coordinating with our friends in Iraq."" He said there is a ""long-term approach"" to fighting ISIS but didn\'t give any more details. The war against ISIS is as much Jordan\'s war as that of any other country in the coalition, he said. ""It is our war. It has been for a long time,"" he said. ""These are outlaws, in a way, of Islam, the minute they set up this irresponsible caliphate to try to expand their dominion over Muslims."" ISIS cannot argue that Jordan and other Muslim nations should not attack them because they\'re fellow Muslims, he said. The militants ""try to make themselves look as victims,"" he said. ""What about the hundreds if not thousands of Muslims they have killed in Syria and Iraq over the past year and a half?"" Jordan has a ""responsibility to reach out to eastern Syria"" and to western Iraq where people have been ""executed in large numbers"" by ISIS, Abdullah insisted. ""So this is our war,"" he said.

What is the significance of the Tunisian jihadist in relation to the terrorist attack at the Bardo Museum?,"['(CNN)ISIS apparently claimed responsibility Thursday for the deadly terrorist attack at a landmark museum in the heart of that country\'s capital, a mass shooting that has shaken the birthplace of the Arab Spring and stirred questions about militants in the country. In an audio statement posted online Thursday, ISIS identified two men -- Abu Zakariya al-Tunisi and Abu Anas al-Tunisi -- it said used ""automatic weapons and hand grenades"" to kill and injure what it called ""crusaders and apostates"" in the Bardo Museum in Tunis. Tunisian Health Minister Said Aidi said 23 people are believed to have been killed, including at least one who died at a hospital overnight. And that bloodshed, the ISIS message warned, is ""just the start."" CNN cannot independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement. A U.S. official told CNN there is no reason to doubt the claim\'s authenticity. That said, American officials are checking the platform that the statement went out on, including the extent to which it\'s tied to the group calling itself the Islamic State. The current U.S. thinking is the attack may have been carried out by local ""franchise"" adherents to ISIS, rather than centrally directed by the Islamist extremist group\'s leadership, which is now thought to be in Syria. The two attackers were carrying explosives, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said in an interview Thursday with the French broadcaster TF1. He credited Tunisian security forces for responding so quickly to the attack to avoid a larger tragedy because ""terrible explosives were found on these (attackers) and they didn\'t have time to use them."" Tunisia has been viewed as the lone democratic success story in the Arab Spring. But the North African nation is not without its issues, including an uneven economy and the distinction of having more citizens -- up to 3,000 Tunisians -- thought to have gone to Iraq and Syria to fight as jihadists than any other country, according to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization in London. Authorities there have already arrested nine people in connection with Wednesday\'s attack, including four directly linked to the bloodshed, according to a statement from Essebsi. Earlier Thursday, Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid identified two suspects, Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou, in an interview with French radio station RTL. It\'s not clear if those two men were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces, or if it\'s possible they\'re the same people as those identified -- using new names -- in ISIS\' audio statement. Labidi was ""known to the security services, he was flagged and monitored,"" Essid said. But he added the man wasn\'t known or being followed for anything special. The siege took place just days after a Tunisian jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, was coming soon, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors terrorist propaganda. In his message, the jihadist claimed to belong to Jund al-Khilafah in Tunisia, a group that in December pledged allegiance to ISIS, even though that vow hadn\'t seemed to have fully registered with the Islamist extremist group. His post comes after an ISIS fighter in the extremist group\'s stronghold of Raqqa in Syria recently appeared in a video questioning why militants in Tunisia had not pledged fealty. ""This raises the possibility that the museum attack could be ISIS\' debut on the Tunisian stage, timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from Tunisian jihadis for maximum impact,"" CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. The attack may have been in and about Tunisia, but the vast majority of the victims were foreigners. They came from various backgrounds, from a Spanish couple to a Colombian mother and son. In addition to those pairs, the dead included three Italians, three Japanese, two French, two Poles, a Belgian, a Russian and a Briton, according to cruise ship companies and their respective governments. Three Tunisians, one of them a security officer and another a job applicant, also were killed, according to Aidi. Twelve of those killed had been aboard the MSC Splendida, a cruise ship with more than 3,700 passengers and nearly 1,300 crew that docked in Tunis hours before the bloodshed, its parent company said in a statement. Five more victims came from a similar vessel, the Costa Fascinosa, which was at port in the Tunisian capital at the same time, according to Costa Cruises. Another 36 people remain hospitalized, while eight others were treated and released. The Bardo had been a logical stop for these tourists, housed next to Tunisia\'s Parliament in a 19th century palace and cast as a ""jewel of Tunisian heritage,"" with its exhibits showcasing the country\'s art, culture and history.

How did the undercover FBI informant play a role in the arrest of the Army National Guard member and his cousin for allegedly conspiring to provide material support to ISIS?,"['(CNN)An Army National Guard member and his cousin have been arrested in Illinois for allegedly conspiring to provide material support to the terrorist organization ISIS, federal prosecutors said Thursday. The alleged plot included a plan to attack a U.S. military installation in Illinois. In the past 18 months, the Justice Department\'s National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting 32 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or providing support to terrorist groups. Of those cases, 18 allegedly involve support to ISIS. Spc. Hasan Edmonds, 22, was arrested Wednesday night at Chicago Midway International Airport while attempting to travel to Egypt to eventually join ISIS, according to Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin and other federal officials said. His cousin, Jonas ""Yunus"" Edmonds, 29, was arrested at his home in Aurora in connection with an alleged plot to carry out an armed attack on an unspecified U.S. military facility in northern Illinois where Hasan Edmonds had been training. The two U.S. citizens were charged, in criminal complaints filed in U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Illinois, with one count each of conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization. The cousins made an initial appearance Thursday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheila Finnegan. Why is ISIS so successful at luring Westerners? After an undercover FBI informant posing as an ISIS fighter outside the United States sent Hasan Edmonds a Facebook ""friend"" request in late 2014, he began to receive private messages from him indicating that he and his cousin were willing to travel to overseas and fight for ISIS, according to the court documents. ""InshAllah we will complete our task or be grants [sic] shahada [Arabic for martyr] I look forward to the training,"" Hasan Edmonds is alleged to have told the informant in January. ""I am already in the American kafir army and now I wish only to serve in the army of Allah alongside my true brothers."" They continued to communicate over the following weeks, with Hasan Edmonds expressing concerns about Jonas Edmonds\' criminal record and whether he would be allowed to travel overseas. ""They try hard to keep people like him trapped in America,"" he told the undercover FBI employee. ""I know several Muslims have been caught attempting the Turkey route so tell me why not many Americans take the Egypt route. I am open to either way,"" Hasan Edmonds told the informant, according to court documents. On February 2, Hasan Edmonds contacted the undercover informant again and said his cousin was willing to carry out an attack on U.S. soil. ""Honestly we would love to do something like the brother in Paris did,"" Hasan Edmonds stated, referring to the French terror attacks in January in which 16 people were killed. Prosecutors said Jonas Edmonds contacted the informant to arrange travel accommodations. ""Number one on my list is Mosul,"" he stated, referring to Iraq\'s second-largest city. ""If I find myself stuck here [in the United States], I intend to take advantage of being so close to the kuffar."" Jonas Edmonds this week accepted that he would be unable to travel and told the FBI informant of his intention to buy AK-47s and grenades to carry out an attack on the military facility. He would use his cousin\'s uniform and ""anticipated a body count of 100 to 150."" He was given a list of officer rankings by his cousin and advised to ""kill the head,"" according to court documents. Prosecutors said Jonas Edmonds planned to carry out the attack after Hasan Edmonds left the country. Hasan Edmonds\' sister said that the family does not believe the allegations against the cousins. ""It\'s all a shock, we don\'t suspect any of these accusations,"" Manchinique Bates told CNN affiliate WLS. ""We do not believe that any of these alleged charges are true.  I honestly do not feel as if my brother is in the U.S. military, but yet leaving the country to join ISIS. That\'s ludicrous. They aren\'t terrorists."" A federal complaint alleges that Hasan Edmonds came to the attention of the FBI in late 2014. The complaints uses the acronym ISIL, or Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Hasan Edmonds planned to use his military training to fight for the terrorist organization, prosecutors said in a statement. Hasan Edmonds booked airline travel to depart Wednesday from Chicago and arrive in Cairo on Thursday. The cousins presented an undercover informant with plans to attacks the military facility, prosecutors said. Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West? ""Disturbingly, one of the defendants currently wears the same uniform of those they allegedly planned to attack,"" Carlin said in the statement. Conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

EVEN expresses the desire for the balance travelers are seeking, says an IHG spokesperson. In its logo, specific colors were chosen to represent elements of nature.

When are the peak blooms expected during the National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington?,"['Washington (CNN)There should be plenty of pent-up anticipation among cherry blossom fans in Washington this spring. Peak blooms are expected at the tail end of the three-week-long National Cherry Blossom Festival, which kicks off Friday and runs through April 12. The fluttering pink and white blossoms are expected to hit their peak between April 11 and April 14. Here are five things to know about the eagerly awaited D.C. blossoms: . The city\'s first cherry trees were destroyed . In 1910, 2,000 cherry trees arrived in Washington, thanks to a gift from the city of Tokyo and the advocacy of Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, one of the first female board members of the National Geographic Society. These trees, however, were riddled with disease and were destroyed. Two years later, first lady Helen Herron Taft planted one of the first of more than 3,000 replacement trees sent from Japan. Winter\'s almost over: See the proof . The festival was launched more than 20 years later . It wasn\'t until 1935 that civic groups and the D.C. government came together to hold the first ""Cherry Blossom Festival."" That first official festival came after smaller commemorations including a three-day celebration in 1934 and a 1927 re-enactment of the original planting of the trees by a group of Washington school children. It\'s not all about cherry trees . That\'s right, there\'s a Blossom Kite Festival right in the middle of the cherry blossom festivities on March 28th. The festival consists of a hot tricks showdown, learning how to make and fly kites, and there\'s even a kite doctor on site to repair broken kites. Two types of trees dominate . In the 1912 gift of trees to Washington, there were 12 different varieties. Today, two varieties are dominant -- Yoshino and Kwanzan. Kwanzan trees are usually found in the East Potomac Park area and produce pink blossoms. The Yoshino, which produce white blossoms, are closer to the northern part of the Tidal Basin near the Washington Monument. Descendants of the original trees live in Japan . In 2011, about 120 trees propagated from D.C.\'s surviving 1912 trees were sent back to Japan to preserve the genetic lineage of the symbolic trees.

Zhanna Nemtsova, who said she has no faith in the Russian investigation into the killing, said she believes his death will only deter other opposition voices, rather than embolden them. ""I cannot blame him (Putin) directly, (but) I would say that our authorities, including the president of Russia, have political responsibility as the head of state,"" Nemtsova told CNN\'s Matthew Chance. Nemtsova says she has no evidence about who ordered the murder, but that ""it\'s evident that it\'s politically motivated."" Nemtsov, 55, was shot dead last Friday night as he walked near the Kremlin with his girlfriend. A former deputy prime minister, he was one of Putin\'s harshest critics and had been arrested several times for speaking against the government. No one has been arrested, though Russia\'s Federal Security Service chief has said there are suspects. The Kremlin has suggested Nemtsov may have been killed by enemies of Russia intent on creating political discord, but many Nemtsov supporters suspect Putin\'s administration of involvement. How Boris Nemtsov\'s murder serves notice to Vladimir Putin\'s enemies . Putin this week called the killing a ""disgrace"" and a tragedy, and he promised to bring those responsible to justice. But Nemtsova, 30, said she does not believe that will happen. She said investigators have not contacted her and she knows nothing of the case except what is in the media. ""I don\'t know where his cellphone and his personal belongings are, so I know only those things which are released or published in the press and nothing else, nothing else,"" she told CNN from Germany, where she is staying for a few days. ""As I have already said, I don\'t have any faith in this investigation."" Nemtsova said she loved her father ""more than anyone else in my life"" and that the two were very close. ""I think that he died a hero,"" she said. ""He was a very brave man, and he was clever, he was a great thinker and he was a brilliant physicist,"" having published dozens of articles on the subject, she said. He was also an economist and pacifist, she said, who most recently had been critical of the Kremlin\'s handling of the Ukraine crisis. ""I know that some Russian officials kept saying that he was not dangerous, but ... in an authoritarian regime, any person who does not agree with politics -- who criticizes the official standpoint -- is dangerous,"" Nemtsova said. ""That\'s why, I think, if you look at other regimes, like in Russia, you will see that all opponents to the official line are in danger, under threat."" Nemtsov was a top official with the Republican Party of Russia-Party of People\'s Freedom, a liberal opposition group. He served as deputy prime minister in the late 1990s under President Boris Yeltsin. Early in his career, he was governor of Nizhniy Novgorod, a major economic hub.

"What factors could affect the selection of the new Senate Democrats leader, considering left-leaning activists and organized labor's concerns about free trade agreements?","['(CNN)Sen. Harry\'s Reid\'s perfunctory announcement on Friday that he won\'t seek re-election next year -- leaving a vacancy for leadership of the Senate Democrats -- was followed, hours later, by a matter-of-fact statement in an interview with The Washington Post: ""I think Schumer should be able to succeed me."" That would usher in a whirlwind of activity on Capitol Hill in the next year as New York\'s senior senator prepares to seize the reins of power -- and retool the party as a center-left powerhouse that can win and hold a majority in 2016 and beyond. Left-leaning activists have begun scrambling to block Chuck Schumer\'s rise. The progressive organization Democracy for America is calling for Sen. Elizabeth Warren to seek the leadership post, and the left-leaning Daily Kos website is circulating a poll seeking other challengers and denouncing Schumer as too close to the ""Wall Street wing"" of the Democratic Party. With more than a year to go before Senate Democrats will choose a new leader, anything can happen. But after watching Schumer in action for more than 20 years, I\'d be surprised if he gets outsmarted in a political moment he has literally been working for a generation to create. With more than $13.4 million on hand in his campaign coffers, Schumer has more money than all but one member of the Senate -- and is the only Democrat in the top 10 in that category. He ran the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee when it took the majority in 2006 -- and while Democrats lost the majority during his second stint in the job in 2012, the field looks far more promising for them in 2016: Republicans must defend 24 seats, while Democrats need to protect only 10. Schumer brings an extraordinary level of personal political skill to the leadership fight. Even among the 100-member Senate -- home to a great many ambitious politicians with big egos -- Schumer has long operated at a high-octane level of smarts and media-savvy brashness that impress and occasionally startle his colleagues. Republican Bob Dole, a longtime lion of the Senate, once quipped that the most dangerous place to be in the Capitol is between Schumer and a television camera. The joke stuck -- but behind the gag is a sign of grudging respect for a man who excels at the basic block-and-tackle necessities of political life. Schumer is attuned to television and radio (growing up in the world\'s media capital will do that). In fact, he popularized a practice of holding press conferences on Sunday, a slow news day guaranteed to draw reporters -- and ensure him prominent placement in the Monday newspapers. But he is also a consummate street politician: At 64, he maintains a habit of biking around New York City neighborhoods without fanfare or an entourage, quietly noting local problems and occasionally inviting himself into a block party or parade. When a reporter once casually asked him to name all 62 counties of New York state, Schumer did her one better, and hand-sketched a map of the state with all the counties filled in. (He visits every county in the state every year.) Schumer isn\'t the only politically ambitious kid from Brooklyn -- before attending Harvard, he graduated from a public school, James Madison High, whose alumni include Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sen. Bernie Sanders and ex-Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota (a childhood pal of Schumer\'s). But Schumer\'s political climb been a long-term work in progress. He emerged on the national stage as a prime sponsor of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a law that banned assault weapons; in the run-up to the final vote, New Yorkers practically couldn\'t turn on television without seeing Schumer, then a congressman, on the floor of the House, waving a rifle over his head as he argued for the ban. The higher profile served him well a few years later, when Schumer took on -- and defeated -- three-term incumbent Sen. Alfonse D\'Amato. As a senator on the rise, Schumer attracted politically ambitious staffers who moved on to high-profile positions where they can help their former mentor. A very partial list of those includes Howard Wolfson, Phil Singer and Blake Zeff, who went on to help run Hillary Clinton\'s 2008 campaign; Ben Lawsky, who is now shaking up the world of finance as New York\'s top banking regulator; Preet Bharara, who has become an anti-corruption powerhouse as a U.S. attorney; and Rodney Capel, who is executive director of the state\'s Democratic Party. With allies, money and the blessing of Reid, Schumer is in a prime position to implement the ideas contained in his important and overlooked 2007 book, ""Positively American,"" which lays out a vision for how Democrats should lead America. Like Schumer himself, the book is savvy, hopeful and politically attuned to the desires of middle-class voters. Those who wonder what a Schumer Senate leadership would look like should take a look as Democrats prepare for what could well be the start of the Schumer era on', '(CNN)Organized labor is up in arms about President Barack Obama\'s effort to obtain fast-track authority to finalize a free trade agreement in the Asia Pacific that involves 11 nations. The agreement, union leaders argue, threatens to take even more jobs away from Americans. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka sent a clear message to members of Congress, warning, ""There is such a dramatic impact on the standard of living and lowering of wages and a loss of jobs -- this will have a major impact, and then we will not forget this vote for a long time."" The AFL-CIO announced that it would withhold donations to political action committees until this controversy cleared up. The tension between organized labor and Obama is not new. The struggles have been going on since 2009 when the President allowed the Employee Free Choice Act to wither in Congress. The act would require that a union be deemed as legitimate when it had the support of a majority of employees and imposed tough penalties on employers who tried to punish workers from forming unions. The President avoided making any strong appeals for the bill, though it was greatly desired by labor organizations as a way to increase membership. When Democrats chose Charlotte, North Carolina, for their 2012 political convention -- a city not friendly to labor -- unions were livid. ""There is broad frustration with the party and all elected officials,"" one labor leader said, ""broad frustration with the lack of a union agenda."" Even though unions were crucial to administration victories such as the Affordable Care Act, President Obama has often been extremely tepid when it comes to the rights of unions. Organized labor has not been that surprised. The truth is that unions have been on the defense against Democratic presidents for decades. In the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter treated unions like one more special interest in Washington that needed to be brought down while President Bill Clinton demonstrated lukewarm support to these organizations as he aggressively pursued global free trade policies that labor opposed. ""It will cost jobs,"" warned Michigan Democrat David Bonior said of the North American Free Trade Agreement that Clinton endorsed. ""It will drive down our standard of living. If we don\'t stand up for the working people in this country, who is going to?"" In the past few decades, many Democratic politicians no longer believed that organized labor was a major player within their party, as they had been during the creation of the New Deal and Great Society. As organized labor became a smaller part of the American workforce, Democratic politicians were not as determined to court their vote. A larger number of Democrats since the 1970s have been elected by upper middle class suburban constituencies in which unions are not a big presence. These voters have been more concerned in a style of liberalism that revolves around quality of life issues, such as environmental regulation, than they are with middle class jobs. Many Democrats leaders embraced a vision of economic policy that centered on deregulation and free markets. New voices that came into the Democratic Party after the 1960s wanted to challenge Republicans by offering a more centrist vision of economic policy. The opportunities for Democrats to embrace a more pro-union agenda have only intensified with the fierce assault taking place among conservatives. The Koch brothers have unleashed fierce financial assault against unions. Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin and potential Republican presidential candidate, has stripped away the power of public unions and signed a right to work law that barred unions from collecting dues from employees who weren\'t in unions. Unions are under assault, and the movement is looking for help. Democrats, and some Republicans, often talk about needing to deal with the problem of economic inequality. Much of the talk is often vague and offers little in the way to real solutions. Shoring up the strength of unions is one area where the government can help protect jobs for middle class Americans. Without strong unions, the battle against economic inequality and insecurity will never really get started. As George Gresham, the president of United Health Care Workers East wrote in The New York Times, ""By defunding unions and weakening union members via \'right to work\' laws, corporations and those that do their bidding remove workers\' primary means of raising wages, securing pensions and improving workers conditions. Workers\' main vehicle for advancing themselves and their communities is jeopardized."" Democrats need to listen to what the AFL-CIO is saying. They need to push back against President Obama, even if this creates political opportunities for Republicans, so that the party does not abandon what has been at the heart and soul of their agenda. As Democrats continually watch Republicans outdo them in terms of organization and pursuit, they need to look to labor more as an ally than an enemy in the battle for the White House and Congress in the coming years.']","Left-leaning activists and organized labor's concerns about free trade agreements could affect the selection of the new Senate Democrats leader.

When will Hillary Clinton announce her 2016 presidential campaign and who will replace Harry Reid as the leader of the Senate Democrats?,"['(CNN)After a handful events in two months, Hillary Clinton has filled her March with a mix of women\'s events, nonprofit speeches and at least one paid appearance. In January and February, Clinton headlined three events -- only one of which was in the United States. But as Clinton moves closer to her expected 2016 presidential campaign announcement, the former secretary or state has at least seven events scheduled for the month of March. Most of Clinton\'s events are focused on one thing: women. Clinton starts her month by headlining the 30th anniversary gala for Emily\'s List -- a pro-Clinton organization that focused on helping Democratic women win elected office. At the D.C. speech on March 3, Clinton is expected to give a nod to the group\'s importance to Democrats and highlight the reason more women are needed in politics. Emily\'s List has been energized by Clinton\'s campaign and has pledged to raise and spend more money than any other election cycle because of the prospect of a Clinton White House. The following week, Clinton will headline two New York events tied to her 1995 speech to the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing -- a speech Clinton regularly references in pitches to women. In that speech Clinton said, ""If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women\'s rights and women\'s rights are human rights once and for all."" On March 9, Clinton teams up with Chelsea, her daughter, and Melinda Gates to release a report through the Clinton Foundation that looks at ""the gaps that still remain"" in women\'s participation in the economy and politics. The following day -- on March 10 -- Clinton will headline the United Nation\'s Women Empowerment Principles annual gathering in New York. Clinton will use the speech to outline the findings in the Clinton Foundation report and ""reflect on progress made in implementing the agenda set in Beijing two decades ago,"" the organizers said in a release about the event. On March 16, Clinton will be inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame at an event in New York. Clinton is not Irish -- her family is of English, Scottish, French, and Welsh descent -- but she is being honored because of ""her dedicated work on Irish Peace Process."" ""Hillary Rodham Clinton is one of the unsung heroes of the success of the Irish peace process,"" said Irish America co-founder Niall O\'Dowd. In 1998, Clinton put together the Vital Voices Conference of women in Belfast, a body that pressed for a piece agreement. The former secretary of state cited her experiences in Ireland during a number of speeches in 2014. O\'Dowd is a longtime Clinton supporter, though,and was a member of her 2008 campaign finance team. Some Republicans have questioned how active Clinton was in the Northern Ireland peace process. The Washington Post Fact Checker wrote in 2008 that Clinton ""seems to be overstating her significance as a catalyst in the Northern Ireland peace process, which was more symbolic than substantive,"" but that she did play ""a helpful role at the margins."" On March 19, Clinton will headline her only confirmed paid speech of the month when she heads to Atlantic City for the American Camp Association, NY & NJ Conference. Susie Lupert, the group\'s executive director, tells CNN, ""Yes, just like most nonprofits and conferences, she is being paid for her appearance."" But she would not confirm how much she is being paid. On average, Clinton makes between $200,000 and $300,000 per speech. Near the end of the month, on March 23 in Washington, D.C., Clinton will be the keynote speaker at the award celebration for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting from Syracuse University. Robin Toner, who graduated from Syracuse, was the first woman national political correspondent for the New York Times. Syracuse Dean Lorraine Branham said Clinton is a ""vivid example — like Robin — of a pioneering woman at the top of her profession."" Clinton headlining an event honoring political journalists is somewhat unique because for decades she has held a dim view of the profession. In a 1996, according to the diary of the late Clinton confidant Diane Blair, Clinton said the media are ""complete hypocrites."" At an event in 2014, Clinton said ""journalism has changed quite a bit in a way that is not good for the country and not good for journalism."" ""A lot of serious news reporting has become more entertainment driven and more opinion-driven as opposed to factual,"" she said. ""People book onto the shows, political figures, commentators who will be controversial who will be provocative because it\'s a good show. You might not learn anything but you might be entertained and I think that\'s just become an unfortunate pattern that I wish could be broken."" Clinton\'s presidential campaign has become a forgone conclusion and Democrats close to Clinton expect she will announce some official move towards the presidency in April.', '(CNN)Sen.

What does King Abdullah II think about ISIS establishing a caliphate and Bashar al-Assad's stance on combating ISIS?,"['(CNN)In his first interview since Islamic State militants burned alive a Jordanian pilot, the King of Jordan spoke to CNN\'s Fareed Zakaria about why and how the country is going after the terror group. Last December, ISIS captured Royal Jordanian Air Force pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh after his plane went down during airstrikes that were part of the United States-led coalition to defeat the group. For more than a month, al-Kasasbeh\'s family, hailing from a high-ranking tribe considered especially loyal to Jordan\'s royal family, implored ISIS to let him go. Hope that he could be spared ended in early February when a video emerged showing the 29-year-old pilot in a cage, being burned alive. King Abdullah II, an instrumental supporter of the global coalition, then said Jordan would be relentless in retaliating against ISIS. The country unleashed airstrikes. To Zakaria, Abdullah reiterated his commitment to stop ISIS. He called its fighters ""outlaws"" who twist Islam and use ""intimidation"" as their biggest weapon. The King told Zakaria that he didn\'t watch the video of the pilot\'s slaying. ""I -- many of us refused to see what I think is propaganda,"" Abdullah said. He felt ""disgust, sadness for the family"" and his ""heart went out to the father, the mother, the brothers, the sisters,"" the King continued. ""His wife, they\'d only been married for five months. (I felt) anger as the son of the Arab army, Jordanian armed forces. God bless his soul. He\'s a brother in arms. ""All soldiers past and present were disgusted by the brutality of what Moath was put through,"" Abdullah said. During his interview with Zakaria, the King repeatedly referred to ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, as Daesh. That\'s an acronym for al-Dawla al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham. Many in the Middle East prefer to use Daesh because, to them, the acronym ISIS suggests the terror group is a legitimate state. They refuse to give the militants that much credit. ""I think if ISIS, or Daesh as we call them, try to intimidate Jordanians ... just (has) the reverse effect,"" Abdullah said. ""If you look at our history, we\'re a country that\'s used to being outgunned and outnumbered. We\'ve always punched way above our weight. I think, if anything, Daesh has us as a tiger by the tail."" The pilot\'s killing ""just motivated Jordanians to rally around the flag,"" he said. ""The gloves have come off."" ISIS is ""always trying to intimidate, scare, put fear in people\'s hearts,"" the King told Zakaria. ""They are trying to invent falsely a linkage to a caliphate, link to our history in Islam that has no truth or bearing to our history."" ISIS is recruiting ""deluded young men and women"" who ""think this is an Islamic nation."" U.S. President Barack Obama has caught flak for saying he didn\'t want to refer to ISIS members as Islamic extremists because their actions are not Islamic. ""I think he is right,"" Abdullah said. ""This is something that has to be understood on a much larger platform. (ISIS) is looking for legitimacy (that) they have inside of Islam."" ""I\'m a Muslim,"" the King said. ""These people (ISIS members) ... are on the fringe of Islam."" ""The barbarity with the way they executed our brave hero (the pilot), I think, shocked the Muslim world, especially Jordanians and people from this region,"" Abdullah said. In the wake of the pilot\'s death, a Jordanian government spokesman vowed an ""earthshaking retaliation."" Zakaria asked Abdullah if Jordan\'s action has lived up to that fiery rhetoric. ""Earth-shattering from all military capabilities is not something that happens overnight,"" he answered, saying that airstrikes have continued. ""There are continued operations going on in Syria. We are coordinating with our friends in Iraq."" He said there is a ""long-term approach"" to fighting ISIS but didn\'t give any more details. The war against ISIS is as much Jordan\'s war as that of any other country in the coalition, he said. ""It is our war. It has been for a long time,"" he said. ""These are outlaws, in a way, of Islam, the minute they set up this irresponsible caliphate to try to expand their dominion over Muslims."" ISIS cannot argue that Jordan and other Muslim nations should not attack them because they\'re fellow Muslims, he said. The militants ""try to make themselves look as victims,"" he said. ""What about the hundreds if not thousands of Muslims they have killed in Syria and Iraq over the past year and a half?"" Jordan has a ""responsibility to reach out to eastern Syria"" and to western Iraq where people have been ""executed in large numbers"" by ISIS, Abdullah insisted. ""So this is our war,"" he said.

What nationalities were the Bardo Museum attack victims and how did the Tunisian security forces respond?,"['(CNN)ISIS apparently claimed responsibility Thursday for the deadly terrorist attack at a landmark museum in the heart of that country\'s capital, a mass shooting that has shaken the birthplace of the Arab Spring and stirred questions about militants in the country. In an audio statement posted online Thursday, ISIS identified two men -- Abu Zakariya al-Tunisi and Abu Anas al-Tunisi -- it said used ""automatic weapons and hand grenades"" to kill and injure what it called ""crusaders and apostates"" in the Bardo Museum in Tunis. Tunisian Health Minister Said Aidi said 23 people are believed to have been killed, including at least one who died at a hospital overnight. And that bloodshed, the ISIS message warned, is ""just the start."" CNN cannot independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement. A U.S. official told CNN there is no reason to doubt the claim\'s authenticity. That said, American officials are checking the platform that the statement went out on, including the extent to which it\'s tied to the group calling itself the Islamic State. The current U.S. thinking is the attack may have been carried out by local ""franchise"" adherents to ISIS, rather than centrally directed by the Islamist extremist group\'s leadership, which is now thought to be in Syria. The two attackers were carrying explosives, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said in an interview Thursday with the French broadcaster TF1. He credited Tunisian security forces for responding so quickly to the attack to avoid a larger tragedy because ""terrible explosives were found on these (attackers) and they didn\'t have time to use them."" Tunisia has been viewed as the lone democratic success story in the Arab Spring. But the North African nation is not without its issues, including an uneven economy and the distinction of having more citizens -- up to 3,000 Tunisians -- thought to have gone to Iraq and Syria to fight as jihadists than any other country, according to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization in London. Authorities there have already arrested nine people in connection with Wednesday\'s attack, including four directly linked to the bloodshed, according to a statement from Essebsi. Earlier Thursday, Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid identified two suspects, Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou, in an interview with French radio station RTL. It\'s not clear if those two men were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces, or if it\'s possible they\'re the same people as those identified -- using new names -- in ISIS\' audio statement. Labidi was ""known to the security services, he was flagged and monitored,"" Essid said. But he added the man wasn\'t known or being followed for anything special. The siege took place just days after a Tunisian jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, was coming soon, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors terrorist propaganda. In his message, the jihadist claimed to belong to Jund al-Khilafah in Tunisia, a group that in December pledged allegiance to ISIS, even though that vow hadn\'t seemed to have fully registered with the Islamist extremist group. His post comes after an ISIS fighter in the extremist group\'s stronghold of Raqqa in Syria recently appeared in a video questioning why militants in Tunisia had not pledged fealty. ""This raises the possibility that the museum attack could be ISIS\' debut on the Tunisian stage, timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from Tunisian jihadis for maximum impact,"" CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. The attack may have been in and about Tunisia, but the vast majority of the victims were foreigners. They came from various backgrounds, from a Spanish couple to a Colombian mother and son. In addition to those pairs, the dead included three Italians, three Japanese, two French, two Poles, a Belgian, a Russian and a Briton, according to cruise ship companies and their respective governments. Three Tunisians, one of them a security officer and another a job applicant, also were killed, according to Aidi. Twelve of those killed had been aboard the MSC Splendida, a cruise ship with more than 3,700 passengers and nearly 1,300 crew that docked in Tunis hours before the bloodshed, its parent company said in a statement. Five more victims came from a similar vessel, the Costa Fascinosa, which was at port in the Tunisian capital at the same time, according to Costa Cruises.

How did W Hotels become a pioneer in the hospitality industry by understanding millennials?,"[' a new Red brand that will, according to Anderson, ""build on the Blu concept and further leverage Radisson\'s brand awareness."" New brands are also being dubbed with what may seem to be random nouns. But there\'s nothing random about them. Last year, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) rolled out EVEN, a new brand cultivated for the growing wellness-minded audience, with two properties in the United States. EVEN expresses the desire for the balance travelers are seeking, says an IHG spokesperson. In its logo, specific colors were chosen to represent elements of nature. The four vertical bars of the logo are off-kilter, while the EVEN letters are composed on a flat horizontal line, representing the brand promise of helping guests stay in balance. Malaysia-based Tune Hotels provides ""five-star beds at a one-star price."" The group has more than 40 properties worldwide, including five in London. Some in its management group were previously senior executives in the music business. It makes sense, then, that a travel company with a musical name would attempt to strike a global chord. Adding to the medley of avant garde brands, Germany\'s Steigenberger Hotel Group\'s Amsterdam hotel Jaz in the City will open in September, with others scheduled to follow. According to Steigenberger Hotel Group, coming Jaz in the City properties will be ""hip and happening hotels"" that ""move to the rhythm of today\'s curious global traveler"" who has a ""desire to embrace authentic experiences in a city hotel."" You can\'t explore the hospitality industry\'s desire to appeal to the millennial mindset without nodding to W Hotels by Starwood.

W\'s target customer was a fashionable, high-energy individual -- someone who\'d now likely be described as having a millennial psychographic.

"Why were the first cherry trees in Washington, D.C. destroyed and who planted the replacement trees?","['Washington (CNN)There should be plenty of pent-up anticipation among cherry blossom fans in Washington this spring. Peak blooms are expected at the tail end of the three-week-long National Cherry Blossom Festival, which kicks off Friday and runs through April 12. The fluttering pink and white blossoms are expected to hit their peak between April 11 and April 14. Here are five things to know about the eagerly awaited D.C. blossoms: . The city\'s first cherry trees were destroyed . In 1910, 2,000 cherry trees arrived in Washington, thanks to a gift from the city of Tokyo and the advocacy of Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, one of the first female board members of the National Geographic Society. These trees, however, were riddled with disease and were destroyed. Two years later, first lady Helen Herron Taft planted one of the first of more than 3,000 replacement trees sent from Japan. Winter\'s almost over: See the proof . The festival was launched more than 20 years later . It wasn\'t until 1935 that civic groups and the D.C. government came together to hold the first ""Cherry Blossom Festival."" That first official festival came after smaller commemorations including a three-day celebration in 1934 and a 1927 re-enactment of the original planting of the trees by a group of Washington school children. It\'s not all about cherry trees . That\'s right, there\'s a Blossom Kite Festival right in the middle of the cherry blossom festivities on March 28th. The festival consists of a hot tricks showdown, learning how to make and fly kites, and there\'s even a kite doctor on site to repair broken kites. Two types of trees dominate . In the 1912 gift of trees to Washington, there were 12 different varieties. Today, two varieties are dominant -- Yoshino and Kwanzan. Kwanzan trees are usually found in the East Potomac Park area and produce pink blossoms. The Yoshino, which produce white blossoms, are closer to the northern part of the Tidal Basin near the Washington Monument. Descendants of the original trees live in Japan . In 2011, about 120 trees propagated from D.C.\'s surviving 1912 trees were sent back to Japan to preserve the genetic lineage of the symbolic trees. Over the years, cuttings from the original trees have also been returned to Japan for horticultural projects.']","The first cherry trees in Washington, D.C. were destroyed due to disease.

How can the government protect middle class jobs and address economic inequality and insecurity?,"['(CNN)Organized labor is up in arms about President Barack Obama\'s effort to obtain fast-track authority to finalize a free trade agreement in the Asia Pacific that involves 11 nations. The agreement, union leaders argue, threatens to take even more jobs away from Americans. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka sent a clear message to members of Congress, warning, ""There is such a dramatic impact on the standard of living and lowering of wages and a loss of jobs -- this will have a major impact, and then we will not forget this vote for a long time."" The AFL-CIO announced that it would withhold donations to political action committees until this controversy cleared up. The tension between organized labor and Obama is not new. The struggles have been going on since 2009 when the President allowed the Employee Free Choice Act to wither in Congress. The act would require that a union be deemed as legitimate when it had the support of a majority of employees and imposed tough penalties on employers who tried to punish workers from forming unions. The President avoided making any strong appeals for the bill, though it was greatly desired by labor organizations as a way to increase membership. When Democrats chose Charlotte, North Carolina, for their 2012 political convention -- a city not friendly to labor -- unions were livid. ""There is broad frustration with the party and all elected officials,"" one labor leader said, ""broad frustration with the lack of a union agenda."" Even though unions were crucial to administration victories such as the Affordable Care Act, President Obama has often been extremely tepid when it comes to the rights of unions. Organized labor has not been that surprised. The truth is that unions have been on the defense against Democratic presidents for decades. In the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter treated unions like one more special interest in Washington that needed to be brought down while President Bill Clinton demonstrated lukewarm support to these organizations as he aggressively pursued global free trade policies that labor opposed. ""It will cost jobs,"" warned Michigan Democrat David Bonior said of the North American Free Trade Agreement that Clinton endorsed. ""It will drive down our standard of living. If we don\'t stand up for the working people in this country, who is going to?"" In the past few decades, many Democratic politicians no longer believed that organized labor was a major player within their party, as they had been during the creation of the New Deal and Great Society. As organized labor became a smaller part of the American workforce, Democratic politicians were not as determined to court their vote. A larger number of Democrats since the 1970s have been elected by upper middle class suburban constituencies in which unions are not a big presence. These voters have been more concerned in a style of liberalism that revolves around quality of life issues, such as environmental regulation, than they are with middle class jobs. Many Democrats leaders embraced a vision of economic policy that centered on deregulation and free markets. New voices that came into the Democratic Party after the 1960s wanted to challenge Republicans by offering a more centrist vision of economic policy. The opportunities for Democrats to embrace a more pro-union agenda have only intensified with the fierce assault taking place among conservatives. The Koch brothers have unleashed fierce financial assault against unions. Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin and potential Republican presidential candidate, has stripped away the power of public unions and signed a right to work law that barred unions from collecting dues from employees who weren\'t in unions. Unions are under assault, and the movement is looking for help. Democrats, and some Republicans, often talk about needing to deal with the problem of economic inequality. Much of the talk is often vague and offers little in the way to real solutions. Shoring up the strength of unions is one area where the government can help protect jobs for middle class Americans. Without strong unions, the battle against economic inequality and insecurity will never really get started. As George Gresham, the president of United Health Care Workers East wrote in The New York Times, ""By defunding unions and weakening union members via \'right to work\' laws, corporations and those that do their bidding remove workers\' primary means of raising wages, securing pensions and improving workers conditions. Workers\' main vehicle for advancing themselves and their communities is jeopardized."" Democrats need to listen to what the AFL-CIO is saying. They need to push back against President Obama, even if this creates political opportunities for Republicans, so that the party does not abandon what has been at the heart and soul of their agenda. As Democrats continually watch Republicans outdo them in terms of organization and pursuit, they need to look to labor more as an ally than an enemy in the battle for the White House and Congress in the coming years.']","Shoring up the strength of unions is one area where the government can help protect jobs for middle class Americans.

What is the impact of reversing Section 66A on freedom of speech in India and what are some examples of enforced cyber laws for online content?,"['(CNN)India\'s highest court has reversed a controversial law that gave the authorities sweeping powers to arrest and potentially jail people for comments posted on social networks and other Internet platforms. The Supreme Court ruled that Section 66A of the 2008 Information Technology Act was ""unconstitutional"" and ""hit at the root of liberty and freedom of expression, the two cardinal pillars of democracy."" Under Section 66A, alleged offenders could face up to three years in jail for posting material that is ""grossly offensive,"" has ""menacing character,"" -- or perhaps even more ambiguously -- causes ""annoyance or inconvenience."" The court said this wording was ""vague"" and could be ""misconstrued,"" according to Ranjeeta Rohatgi, an advocate who was present at the hearing in Delhi Tuesday. India\'s cyber laws have ignited a furious debate about curbs on freedom of speech in recent years.  In 2012, a university professor was arrested for circulating a cartoon that poked fun at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. The cartoon, which was a parody of a scene in a popular Indian movie, went viral on social media. He was charged with a range of offenses including defamation, insulting a woman and sending offensive messages from a computer. Mahapatra called the charges a misuse of the law ""in the name of surveillance, to curb democratic rights, freedom of speech and human rights of common people."" A year earlier, Delhi went one step further with its digital crackdown when the so-called ""intermediary guidelines"" implicated web platforms themselves. The rules now require Internet companies to take down any content seen as ""disparaging,"" ""blasphemous,"" or ""defamatory"" within 36 hours of a user submitting a formal request for removal. In Mumbai, India\'s financial center, police spokesman Dhananjay Kulkarni told CNN in February that some 650 posts and pages were blocked last year under these regulations. Google says in the last half of 2013 it removed 540 items from its pages in compliance with orders issued by Indian courts, government agencies, and law enforcement. It\'s a similar story with Facebook. The social networking site took down nearly 5,000 pieces of content reported by the Indian government in the first half of 2014. CNN\'s Harmeet Shah Singh and Kunal Sehgal in Delhi, as well as Mackenzie Sigalos in Hong Kong contributed to this report.']","The reversal of Section 66A has a positive impact on freedom of speech in India as it was deemed unconstitutional and a violation of liberty and freedom of expression.
